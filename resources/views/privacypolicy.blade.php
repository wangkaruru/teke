                            <p>The taxi hailing business in Nairobi has become quite fierce since Uber paved the way for others in January 2015. Since then, a number of taxi hailing companies have popped up to try getting a size-able piece in the taxi business.

Uber is the front-runner in this case and the road has not been smooth for them. They launched UberX in Kenya with an original pricing of 60 KES/km, 4 KES/ minute, 100 KES base fare and a minimum fare of KES 300. This was revised when Safaricom’s Little Cabs came into the picture with their revised rates where Uber slashed their price by 35%.

However, that decision did not sit well with drivers who are in the Uber ecosystem that prompted a strike and they had to come up with a revised system which they announced today. The new prices are not as high as the original prices but they are definitely higher than what they announced after making the 35 % cut.

Since Uber decided to jack up their prices to satisfy their partners, you might be curious what other taxi hailing services are offering. The taxi hailing services in question apart from Uber are Little Cabs, Taxify, Mondo Ride and Mara Moja. I also concentrated on the basic prices you can get for each service.
